# AirBnB_NYC_price_prediction
The following notebook showcases my analysis of AirBnB listings dataset originally posted on Kaggle by Dgomonov. The listings were scrapped on July 8th 2019 and are specific to NYC, NY. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).
<br>
Our objective in this project is to predict the price of a listing on Airbnb based on the predictors we have. We will also try to find out which feature is the most important or influences price the most.

Tools: EDA, Feature engineering/selection, Feature scaling, Imputation, Gradient boosting regressor, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Model Optimization
